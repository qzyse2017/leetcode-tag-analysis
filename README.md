# leetcode-tag-analysis
Analyze the correlation between diiferent tags of the same problem and get some strategies to help solve them

# Idea
I found that tags which appear once together may have greater probability together compared with those who have not appeared together on the same problems.

And thus I guess I may get some strategies to guide me in choosing the right solution(algorithms) faster.

No goal for a specific date I could finish it, created the repository first to remind myself...
